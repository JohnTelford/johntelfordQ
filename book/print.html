<p>The website is organized into <em>chapters</em>.
Each chapter is a separate page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<h2 id="navigation"><a class="header" href="#navigation">Navigation</a></h2>
<p>There are several methods for navigating through the chapters of the website.</p>
<p>The <strong>sidebar</strong> on the left provides a list of all chapters.
Clicking on any of the chapter titles will load that page.</p>
<p>The sidebar may not automatically appear if the window is too narrow, particularly on mobile displays.
In that situation, the menu icon (three horizontal bars) at the top-left of the page can be pressed to open and close the sidebar.</p>
<p>The <strong>arrow buttons</strong> at the bottom of the page can be used to navigate to the previous or the next chapter.</p>
<p>The <strong>left and right arrow keys</strong> on the keyboard can be used to navigate to the previous or the next chapter.</p>
<h2 id="top-menu-bar"><a class="header" href="#top-menu-bar">Top menu bar</a></h2>
<p>The menu bar at the top of the page provides some icons for interacting with the website.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Icon</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><i class="fa fa-bars"></i></td><td>Opens and closes the chapter listing sidebar.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i class="fa fa-paint-brush"></i></td><td>Opens a picker to choose a different color theme.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i class="fa fa-search"></i></td><td>Opens a search bar for searching within the book.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i class="fa fa-print"></i></td><td>Instructs the web browser to print the entire book.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Tapping the menu bar will scroll the page to the top.</p>
<h2 id="search"><a class="header" href="#search">Search</a></h2>
<p>Pressing the search icon (<i class="fa fa-search"></i>) in the menu bar, or pressing the <code>S</code> key on the keyboard will open an input box for entering search terms.
Typing some terms will show matching chapters and sections in real time.</p>
<p>Clicking any of the results will jump to that section.
The up and down arrow keys can be used to navigate the results, and enter will open the highlighted section.</p>
<p>After loading a search result, the matching search terms will be highlighted in the text.
Clicking a highlighted word or pressing the <code>Esc</code> key will remove the highlighting.</p>

<p>This website discusses optimizing website project life time costs. It describes using a site generator for developing and deploying websites. It is based on <em>Iterative Development</em> and <em>Web Component Technologies</em>.</p>
<p>The basic idea of <em>Iterative Development</em> is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing iterative development teams to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system. </p>
<p><em>Web Component Technologies</em> enable creating reusable custom elements, with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of the code, and utilized in website development.</p>
<p>Iterative web development teams working together can help optimizing website costs and lower some the difficulties creating websites.</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<h2 id="difficulties"><a class="header" href="#difficulties">Difficulties</a></h2>
<p>Creating and maintaining websites that meet users needs are difficult, complex, time consuming.</p>
<p>Website life time cost will be higher if defects are not mitigated early.</p>
<h3 id="slow"><a class="header" href="#slow">Slow</a></h3>
<p>More than half of mobile user will leave a page that takes longer than 3 seconds to load and may never return. Optimizing websites to maximize performance is important.</p>
<h3 id="content"><a class="header" href="#content">Content</a></h3>
<p>Most People visit websites for content. They have little interest in how the content is created or how it gets to their screen. Most access websites using mobile devices. Everyone wants websites pages to load quick and pages that conform to their screen size. The website look and feel, users experience, functionality, also needs to be consistent and complement the content.</p>
<p>The Google <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/">PageSpeed Insights</a> website reports on the performance of websites on both mobile and desktop devices, and provides suggestions on how pages may be improved.</p>
<p>Google reports mobile website pages load within 22 seconds on average. However, 53 percent of mobile users will leave a page that takes longer than 3 seconds to load.</p>

<h2 id="iterative-development-teams"><a class="header" href="#iterative-development-teams">Iterative Development Teams</a></h2>
<p>Teams work together delivering their work to other teams during the website life time.</p>
<p>The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations sometime during the life time of the website.</p>

<p>Iterative website development enables the <em>Define, Design, Develop, Deploy and Maintain</em> teams to be operational at the same time creating, testing, and remediating defects.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="defect-remediation-costs"><a class="header" href="#defect-remediation-costs">Defect Remediation Costs</a></h2>
<p>The highest cost over the life time of website projects may be remediating defects.</p>
<p>Content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:</p>
<img src="bugFixChart.jpg" height= 400 width=400 />
<p><strong>Defect Remediation Costs</strong></p>
<p>Some of the early defect detection mechanisms built into  using a site generator are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>vscode</code> editor tool extensions continually check for syntax and other errors</li>
<li>Fast refresh live-editing quickly show changes while typing, and any runtime errors</li>
<li>Team members frequently deploying their copy of the project repository with their changes, to private websites where stakeholders can see them and give feedback.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="minimum-viable-product"><a class="header" href="#minimum-viable-product">Minimum Viable Product</a></h2>
<p>The first goal of website development projects is get to a <em>Minimum Viable Product</em>. </p>
<p>It is a way to understand whether the website project idea will work or not. It is a stage in website development where the <em>must</em> features are implemented and ready to test with end-users. It gives feedback about the positive aspects and shortcomings.</p>
<p>The next steps are adding the <em>want</em> features, until stakeholders agree the website is production quality and ready to be deployed.</p>

<p>The Team Iterative Development Stack is the same as Developer Iterative Development Stack. The difference is there are more than one developer. There would be confusion and possible defects created if the developers were to directly make changes to the same repository.</p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to have one central repository controlled by a gatekeeper. Each team member <code>fork</code>s a copy to their GetHub account and makes a <code>git clone</code> of it on their workstation. </p>
<p>Each developer makes changes to their <code>git clone</code> repository. They cannot directly make changes to the central repository. Team members may deploy their copy of the clone repository with their changes, to a private Internet website for stakeholders to see and give feedback.</p>
<p>This process is managed using Microsoft free <a href="https://github.com/team">Git Hub for Teams</a> product. When stakeholders determine a developers changes, defect fixes, or new features are ready, a GitHub <code>pull</code> request is made by the developer to the central project repository. Project team members and the gatekeeper are notified by GitHub of the <code>pull</code> request. They may examine, comment on, suggest possible changes, and possibly test the code. When the team agrees on the developers changes, they are committed to the central project repository by the gatekeeper. This process is repeated for each developer changes. Iterations of the central project repository may be deployed by the gatekeeper to a private website for stakeholders viewing.</p>
<p>The next step is each developer <code>pull</code>s the central repository changes and commits them to their copy of the central project repository. This process keeps team members up to date</p>
<p>The central project repository may be deployed to the public Internet by the gatekeeper after stakeholders agree there have been sufficient iterations.</p>

<p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

<p>John Gruber published the original Markdown Syntax Guide. Different flavors of Markdown have evolved since then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Markdown is a better way to write HTML. It is compiled into HTML at deploy time. Markdown is a lightweight plaintext markup language used to add formatting elements to documents. Markdown is now one of the world’s popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown is not like that. In a Markdown-formatted file. Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases look different.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Markdown has been characterized by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. They are driven by the need for additional features like tables, footnotes, definition lists, and HTML inside Markdown blocks. The behavior of additional features diverge from the reference implementation and informal specification, and have attracted attention. Not all flavors of Markdown are compatible or supported by all frameworks.</p>
<p>I'm hesitant creating website material without using a version of Markdown. My preference is using MDX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❤️ Powerful: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in React/JSX-based projects.</p>
<p>💻 Everything is a component: Use existing components inside MDX file and import other MDX files as plain components.</p>
<p>🔧 Customizable: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown element.</p>
<p>📚 Markdown-based: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains, JSX is interleaved when you want to.</p>
<p>🔥 Blazingly blazing fast: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm hesitant creating website material without using a version of Markdown. My preference is using MDX.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>❤️ Powerful: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in React/JSX-based projects.</p>
<p>💻 Everything is a component: Use existing components inside MDX file and import other MDX files as plain components.</p>
<p>🔧 Customizable: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown element.</p>
<p>📚 Markdown-based: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains, JSX is interleaved when you want to.</p>
<p>🔥 Blazingly blazing fast: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs during the build stage.&quot;</p>

<p>The key hardware for website developers are workstations</p>
</div>

<hr />
<p>Web site development is not easy, time consuming, and expensive. Optimizing the web development environment is critical.</p>
<p>The key hardware for web developers are workstations. They need to be fast, reliable, supportable, secure, support large screens, and work with web software development applications</p>
<p>The contemporary choice for web development workstations are Apple, Linux, and Microsoft. I have experience building websites with purchased and building bare metal Linux systems and bare metal Microsoft systems. I use apple products for exploring Internet technologies and creating web sites.</p>
<p>Traditionally companies built workstation products with Intel processors. They are diversifying their product line with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM-based</a> processors</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="AppleLogo.png" alt="Apple" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a> is a computer manufacturing company delivering workstation products with Apple developed macOS certified UNIX operating systems.</p>
<p>Apple recently released the first Mac products built with the ARM-based, Apple silicon designed, processors, and the macOS Big Sur operating system engineered to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1">M1</a> chip capabilities.</p>
<p>The last Apple processor transition was the Motorola 68000 to the Intel x86. It took time for Apple vendors and users to update their hardware and software to run on the x86. Apple created the Rosetta translation application that ran Motorola 68000 binary code on x86 machines. The M1 translation layer Rosetta 2, is about 80% the speed of the of native Apple Silicon code. The single-core Rosetta 2 benchmark running on a low end M1 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM, is faster than other x86 Mac machines in single core benchmark. The M1 MacBook Air running native is faster than any competitors top of the line x86 machine, except for a couple.</p>
<p>Apple products prices may be higher than their competitors. It is mitigated by the quality of hardware and software, robustness, security, and vendor support.</p>
<p>Any unnecessary web developer workstation downtime is expensive. The advantages of Apple products are robustness, reliability, security, speed, vendor hardware and software support, and relative ease to use. Apple has responsibility for maintaining hardware and software products from sale to retirement. Apple Stores and other services are equipped to diagnose and repair Apple products.</p>
<p>Operating systems updates have been free for years, and Apple continues to have the highest customer satisfaction in the industry.</p>

<p>Linux is the leading operating system on web servers. Its greatest success in the consumer market is mobile device. Android being one of the dominant smartphones Linux-based operating system</p>
<p>There are a some Linux vendor supported hardware platforms or Linux software distributions. The diversity of Linux distributions means that not all software or hardware runs all distributions or applications. Software and software repositories may be specific to a particular distribution</p>
<p>Not all peripheral device vendors support Linux. The Linux open-source community supplies several missing device drivers.</p>
<p>The price of Linux-based systems is attractive. The operating system software is free. Ready-made hardware platforms are available, or can be bare metal built by choosing hardware and software components, and having the skills to assemble and maintain them.</p>
<p>The robustness, reliability, security, and speed of Linux systems varies from low to high, depending on the knowledge and skills of the vendors, builders and maintainers</p>
<p>Responsibility for maintaining Linux workstation hardware, operating systems, and device drivers is fragmented or doesn't exist, except from the vendors, builders and maintainers</p>

Microsoft <em>Windows</em> is a proprietary graphical operating system developed and marketed by Microsoft. Windows is the most used operating system on servers, personal computers desktops, laptops, and game consoles. Microsoft also manufactures Surface laptops and Xbox.</p>
<p>Many companies sell hardware platforms with Microsoft Windows installed. Many peripheral device vendors support Windows drivers.</p>
<p>Consumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features built in from the outset. Windows updates are regularly improving security.</p>
<p>Windows is one of hackers prime data hunting grounds, even with frequent security updates. Windows systems are everywhere and stores or has access to vast amounts of data. There are Windows installations that do not keep Windows updated. One reason may be issues with updates. Microsoft Windows update problem 2021 are recent examples.</p>
<p>The reliability, robustness, security, and supportability of Microsoft systems varies from low to high, depending on the knowledge and skills of vendors, builders and maintainers. The combinations and permutations of vendor hardware platforms, software applications, and peripheral vendors and device support, may be contributing to Microsoft Windows update problems.</p>

<p>John Gruber published the original Markdown Syntax Guide. Different flavors of Markdown have evolved since then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Markdown is a better way to write HTML. It is compiled into HTML at deploy time. Markdown is a lightweight plaintext markup language used to add formatting elements to documents. Markdown is now one of the world’s popular markup languages. Using Markdown is different from using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown is not like that. In a Markdown-formatted file. Markdown syntax is added to the text to indicate which words and phrases look different.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Markdown has been characterized by an informal specification and a reference implementation for conversion to HTML. Over time, many Markdown implementations have appeared. They are driven by the need for additional features like tables, footnotes, definition lists, and HTML inside Markdown blocks. The behavior of additional features diverge from the reference implementation and informal specification, and have attracted attention. Not all flavors of Markdown are compatible or supported by all frameworks.</p>
