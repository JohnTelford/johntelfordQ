[Apple](https://www.apple.com) is a computer manufacturing company delivering workstation products with Apple developed macOS certified UNIX operating systems.

Apple recently released the first Mac products built with the ARM-based, Apple silicon designed, processors, and the macOS Big Sur operating system engineered to use [M1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) chip capabilities.

The last Apple processor transition was the Motorola 68000 to the Intel x86. It took time for Apple vendors and users to update their hardware and software to run on the x86. Apple created the Rosetta translation application that ran Motorola 68000 binary code on x86 machines. The M1 translation layer Rosetta 2, is about 80% the speed of the of native Apple Silicon code. The single-core Rosetta 2 benchmark running on a low end M1 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM, is faster than other x86 Mac machines in single core benchmark. The M1 MacBook Air running native is faster than any competitors top of the line x86 machine, except for a couple.

Apple products prices may be higher than their competitors. It is mitigated by the quality of hardware and software, robustness, security, and vendor support.

Any unnecessary web developer workstation downtime is expensive. The advantages of Apple products are robustness, reliability, security, speed, vendor hardware and software support, and relative ease to use. Apple has responsibility for maintaining hardware and software products from sale to retirement. Apple Stores and other services are equipped to diagnose and repair Apple products.

Operating systems updates have been free for years, and Apple continues to have the highest customer satisfaction in the industry.
