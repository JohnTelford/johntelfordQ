## Prerequisites

Website design prerequisites are making decisions about , Responsive Website Design, Consistency, Theme, Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interaction.

I have reincarnated JohnTelford.com using several of these and other [Development Frameworks](https://docusaurus.io/docs#comparison-with-other-tools). The last two reincarnations have been:

### Docusaurus

The perquisites requirements for this website can be realized using the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) development framework. Any of the Docusaurus attributes may be changes.

The website design prerequisites can be realized using the Docusaurus development framework.

### mdbook

The [mdbook](https://crates.io/crates/mdbook) uses [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) with imbedded HTML. It does not abstract`React`

This website is Brochureware. I found it was faster, cleaner, and less complicated to create it using `mdbook`.

I recommend using `Docusaurus` for a more complex user interface and material because it abstracts `react` so one can use `mdx` and `jsx`.

## Responsive Website Design

The majority of users access websites using mobile devices. They and others have little tolerance for slow loading website pages or pages that do not conform to their screen size.

Website design ensures pages load quickly and adjust to display size. Website pages are display correctly on a variety of devices and window or screen size. The website look and feel, users experience, and functionality maintain consistency.

### Consistency

Website consistency is the look and feel of the site. The users experience, and functionality does not vary between website pages.

---

### Theme

The website theme is the Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interface.

- Color scheme

  - Header
  - Website page
  - Fonts
  - Footer

- Typology
- Navigation
