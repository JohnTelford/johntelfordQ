Web site development is not easy, time consuming, and expensive. Optimizing the web development environment is critical.

The key hardware for web developers are workstations. They need to be fast, reliable, supportable, secure, support large screens, and work with web software development applications

The contemporary choice for web development workstations are Apple, Linux, and Microsoft. I have experience building websites with purchased and building bare metal Linux systems and bare metal Microsoft systems. I use apple products for exploring Internet technologies and creating web sites.

Traditionally companies built workstation products with Intel processors. They are diversifying their product line with [ARM-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) processors
